To run: 

1. get a list of levels from the frodo sql explorer:

    * use the level_query.sql file in this directory for the query
    * be sure to replace 'f18k' with the relevant cohort ID

2. Export the csv file from the sql explorer

3. Save it to this directory and call it levels.csv.

4. Run the script (it's randomized), answering "n" until you get a result you
like -- then answer 'y'. The  results will be saved in YYYYMMDD_pastpairs.csv so
that it can be used next go-around to avoid repeating partners.

5. Profit.
