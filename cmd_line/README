To run: 

1. get a list of levels from the frodo sql explorer: 

http://fellowship.hackbrightacademy.com/explorer/34/?params=cohort_id%3A<<cohort id>> 
(replace <<cohort id>> with the actual cohort id; e.g. f17g)

2. Export the csv file from the sql explorer

3. Save it to this directory and call it levels.csv, removing the "name,level" 
first line

4. Run the script (it's randomized) until you get a result you like. The 
results will be saved in YYYYMMDD_pastpairs.csv so that it can be used next
go-around to avoid repeating partners. 

5. Profit.
